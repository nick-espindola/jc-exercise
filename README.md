I was tasked with an exercise to Expose and HTTP endpoint at the URL /manage_file that accepts a JSON payload.  I havent built API's before so after a little reasearch I came up with test2.py and the unit_test.py, I am not completely sure they work correctly but I gave it a shot.  

I built this using PyCharm with Flask, I created a virtual environment in PyCharm to build it out, which was pretty helpful with creating it.  Make sure you have Python3 installed.

I put the files in here in Github as a test then did a little pipeline with them and merged to main.
